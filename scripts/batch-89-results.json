We meet the people behind the on-screen characters and discover what drove Louis to glorify his reign on a scale unmatched by any previous monarch, examine the tension between Louis and his brother Philippe, a battle hero and overt homosexual, and they meet the coterie of women who competed for Louis's attention.  We see that Louis was ruthless in his pursuit of glory and succeeded in defeating his enemies. In his record-breaking 72-year reign, France became renowned for its culture and sophistication.",

In between they recall past glories of the tradition of \"Fifteen\" while gazing at the touristic traffic across Santorini's volcanic bay. ACROSS HER BODY questions issues of faith, identity and gender by correlating three distinct bodies: the \"unspoiled\" body of the Virgin Mary, the deserted body of the once upon a time fertile Therasia and the aging female bodies of the fifteeners. It's an homage to an archetype of Greek motherhood that was common place in the post war society and is becoming obsolete in modern Greece.",

Among his many fans is the boisterous Archana, a girl working at a creative agency – which designs branded memes. She is leukodermic but lives life to the fullest. They meet; or rather talk, for the first time over a misplaced call, when Archana accidentally dials Alfaaz's number, while trying to connect with her latest blind date. Thus begins an interesting relationship between two unlikely characters, one overly compensating, but in denial of her present, and the other buried under a dark secret of his past.",

Marcello quickly becomes infatuated with Luisa, but is also conflicted regarding her supposed profession.
