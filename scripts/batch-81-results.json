Bonhoeffer was accused of being associated with the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and was then quickly tried along with other accused plotters, including former members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office). He was hanged on 9 April 1945, four weeks before the surrender of the Third Reich.",

    "overview": "Grappling with what it means to be a woman in comedy in a post #metoo world, and the inherit misogyny of the comedy industry, this is a delightful comedy special from Scottish comic Eleanor Morton. The show is clever social commentary revolving around Eleanor's confident American alter ego, and the reality of what it means to inhabit the real world and confront double standards in the comedy industry as her real, Scottish self. Eleanor has performed at The Fringe 6 times, and her 2014 show Lollipop was nominated for a Scottish Comedy Award for Best Show.",

But the biggest twist in this most beloved of tales, is leaving the poetry of Iambic Pentameter in the past, for the original pop music that rockets these ever-present themes right to the heart of our characters in the most surprising, and perhaps most powerful way that has ever been seen, or heard, before... The greatest love story of all time, set to the greatest music of our time.",
