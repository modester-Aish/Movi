Some call him the 'inventor of the selfie'. A street photographer ahead of his time he pioneered techniques to capture images of ordinary people and their working lives in a way no-one else could. Imprisoned for his beliefs, he lived his last years alone in the ghost town he helped bring to life, his family believing him dead. JOS is a journey of discovery following a historian, a photographer and a museum curator all working to give Jos Divis' the recognition he deserves.",

Instead, Kelton describes the national debt as simply a historical record of the number of dollars created by the US federal government currently being held in pockets, as assets, by the rest of us.  MMT bursts into the media with journalists asking, “Have we been thinking about how the government spends money, all wrong?” But top economists from across the political spectrum condemn the theory as “voodoo economics”, “crazy” and “a crackpot theory”.  FINDING THE MONEY traces the conflict all the way back to the story we tell about money, injecting new hope and empowering countries around the world to tackle the biggest challenges of the 21st century: from climate change to inequality.",
