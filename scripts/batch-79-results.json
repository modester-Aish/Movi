By 1978 they were a behemoth of the local rock scene and on the path to international success… until they just missed their chance. Yet they still revolutionised the Aussie music scene transforming it from pretty pop to gritty guitar rock featuring ferocious and theatrical live shows. Adelaide director Maddie Parry (Hannah Gadsby: Nanette) has made a surprisingly intimate documentary, with band members’ home videos and never-before-seen photos, exploring the internal tensions that strained relationships to breaking point, even while producing incandescent rock’n’roll.  - AFF",

In the 15 years after the end of WW2 Hamburg had become the vice capital of Europe. Its neon lit streets were home to sailors, prostitutes, drug dealers, gangs and low life. The group was still developing. At the time of their first Hamburg adventure, George Harrison, was only 17 years old. They were all still very young men, and their group was virtually unknown.

What is it like to be a human being and spending your whole life trying to express something through sounds? The characters wake up, rehearse, record, perform and talk about music. In some moments they are on the edge, the edge of existence, constantly challenging themselves. They listen. They devote themselves to finding a space to create a connection to something bigger than themselves. Something that will outlast all of us.",

But, as director Celeste Geer discovers, it doesn’t have to be this way. Following Then the Wind Changed, her Walkley Award-winning film about rebuilding after the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, she sought answers to why, after decades of warnings, we continue to shirk the necessary measures that will prevent all-out climate catastrophe.",

The debt contemporary culture has towards Munch is impressive, from Andy Warhol to Ingmar Bergman, from Marina Abramovich to Jasper Johns. If his painting has become a symbol and at the same time an omen of the tragedies of the twentieth century, his art has travelled new and experimental roads of extraordinary modernity. Today, however, it is his city, Oslo, which sets a turning point for the knowledge of Munch: the birth of a new museum opened in Fall 2021. The documentary will start from there to shed light on a man and an artist with singular charm, a precursor and a master.",

Though dead according to our biomedical standards, they often stay sitting upright in meditation; remarkably, their bodies remain fresh and lifelike, without signs of decay for days, sometimes weeks after clinical death.  Following ground-breaking scientific research into tukdam and taking us into intimate death stories of Tibetan meditators, the film juxtaposes scientific and Tibetan perspectives as it tries to unravel the mystery of tukdam.",
