He finds out that the killer is a goon named Rhino and, with vengeance on his mind, tracks him down in Bolivia. The trouble is that the guy works for a local drug lord and the only way for C.J. to get to Rhino is to prove himself with his fists. However, the druglord doesn't want his best goon hurt, so he arranges for the corrupt local authorities to bust C.J. and send him to prison. The only way out is fighting the prison's monstrous colossal cage-fighting champ known as the Beast, who's never left an opponent breathing. Druglord's hot blond Caucasian girlfriend, Ellen, tired of being at the criminal's mercy, decides to help C.J. anyway she can. Even with all the odds against him, C.J. is no pushover and Rhino slowly becomes worried.",

Rather than featuring one continuous narrative, the film expresses the influence of fandom and innocence through a collection of short films about Jackson, some of which are long-form music videos from Jackson's 1987 album Bad. The film is named after his famous dance, \"the moonwalk\", which he originally learned as \"the backslide\" but perfected the dance into something no one had seen before. The movie's introduction is a type of music video for Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\" but is not the official video for the song. The film then expresses a montage of Michael's career, which leads into a parody of his Bad video titled \"Badder\", followed by sections \"Speed Demon\" and \"Leave Me Alone\". What follows is the biggest section where Michael plays a hero with magical powers and saves three children from Mr. Big. This section is \"Smooth Criminal\" which leads into a performance of \"Come Together\".",
