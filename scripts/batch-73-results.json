The music in the film builds upon Ólafur’s critically praised new album ‘some kind of peace’ and was performed and recorded live on set, representing a constant cinematic conversation between picture and music. Vincent Moon’s intimate cinematic vision brings this layered metaphorical world to life as we see Ólafur’s music manifested and symbolised all around him through set design, lighting and dance.  Through themes of rituals, relationships and exploration of our inner landscapes, this is a film focused on how we all move forward.",

Henry Dundas, a Scot, was one of the most influential 18th century Tory politicians who held powerful roles during the height of the British Empire.  This BAFTA-winning documentary directed by Parisa Urquhart follows the deeply personal debate over how Dundas should be acknowledged on the monument. Scotland’s first black professor Sir Geoff Palmer argues that Dundas deliberately delayed the abolition of the slave trade. Whereas, Dundas’ direct descendent aristocrat Bobby Dundas, argues that his ancestor was an abolitionist.",

Oscar-nominated filmmaker Daniel Raim puts us in the director's chair and in Jewison's heart and mind, drawing on behind-the-scenes footage and never-before-seen stills as well as original interviews with Jewison, Topol (Tevye), composer John Williams, production designer Robert F. Boyle, film critic Kenneth Turan, lyricist Sheldon Harnick, and actresses Rosalind Harris, Michele Marsh, and Neva Small (Tevye’s daughters).

Zsófi discovers late that she is pregnant and decides to give up her baby through open adoption to an infertile couple. Bea cannot accept her daughter’s decision, but she does not realize that neither Zsófi, nor the circumstances, are suitable to welcome a newborn. Zsófi has always had to behave like a grown-up, working and making sensible decisions, instead of her mother and for her sister. She is still in high school and her only advantage is her table tennis career, for which she works assiduously. She plans the adoption thoroughly with the help of a social worker. Following the birth, she is given six weeks by law to change her mind and ask for her child back. She seems to be able to control her feelings ruthlessly and continue towards the goals she has set. At the same time, her maternal feelings intensify, doubts arise, and she slowly begins to question her decisions.",

He has just finished shooting his last movie and he’s deeply sad. The movie is inspired by the novel about Casanova written by Arthur Schnitzler, a character so similar to the director, even more than he could imagine. Schnitzler’s Casanova is aged, glory days are over: he lost his charm and his attraction to women, he’s broke and no more eager to travel through Europe. After a long exile, he just wants to go back to Venice, his homeland. While traveling home Casanova meets a girl, Marcolina. She reawakens his desire, lost for years. So, he tries to seduce her but that leads him to a tragic understanding: he’s an old man now. It’s not by chance that Leo Bernardi decided to tell this story right now, in a pivotal moment of his life and career. The destiny of both Casanova and his director leads them to a final confrontation.",
