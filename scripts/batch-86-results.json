Later joined by his wife Oria and daughters Saba and Dudu, elephants became central to their lives with matriarch Boadicea and gentle young mother Virgo cherished like human relatives. But this garden Eden was short-lived as an ivory poaching epidemic swept across Africa forcing Iain to switch from pioneering scientist to maverick conservationist. He became a lone crusader against the international Ivory trade which was finally banned in 1989. Now back in the field and revealing even more about the fascinating world of elephants, Iain’s work continues alongside a new generation of Kenyan conservationists. This inspiring documentary combines stunning wildlife imagery with the story of a remarkable life showing how sometimes you have to stand alone to protect what you love.",

With horrifying accounts of abuse that spanned Al Fayed’s 25-year reign at Harrods, for the first time the scale and seriousness of these allegations are exposed, as well as the system that helped cover it up.

What role did a love triangle, the mafia, drugs and a mysterious Lebanese man play in the case? To answer these questions, years later, both Aneta's mother and the public have built an exact replica of the crime scene in the studio. A reconstruction of the site was carried out with the participation of the world's leading experts in psychology, toxicology, pathology and biomechanics. Will the conclusions of the British, Canadian, American and French experts match those reached by the Czech police? Will the victim's mother at least get the truth after ten years?",

    "year": 2025,
    "overview": "When Bradford City FC met Lincoln City on 11 May 1985 for the final game of the season, what everyone hoped to remember was the carnival atmosphere in the stadium. But what happened at the end of a goalless first half was instead the stuff of nightmares.   A fire, believed to have been started by a discarded cigarette or match, engulfed one of the old wooden stands. 56 lives were lost, and the event made headlines around the world as the city and the nation struggled to confront the enormity of the loss to Bradford. The prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, travelled to the scene of the disaster as the media looked to someone to blame, and a senior judge was appointed to launch an inquiry. The findings would have a long-lasting impact on safety at football matches in Britain and around the world.   With access to survivors, family members of those lost and emergency service first responders, this film aims to relive a largely forgotten tragedy",

However, beneath the allure lies a city controlled by the American mafia, where luxury contrasts sharply with the poverty endured by most Cubans. U.S. tourists escape Prohibition and moral restrictions back home. Icons like Ernest Hemingway, Frank Sinatra, and Ava Gardner revel in the city’s rhythms, frequenting hotspots like the Hotel Nacional and the Tropicana nightclub. Yet beneath the surface, corruption and oppression grip Cuba. Dictator Fulgencio Batista secretly partners with the mafia to build a “Las Vegas in the Caribbean” fueling unrest as the Cuban people suffer.
