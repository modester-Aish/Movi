But Zwingli's success quickly becomes dangerous. His ideas almost trigger a civil war, and at the same time a struggle for power and interpretive sovereignty breaks out in the inner circle of the movement. When the Catholic forces begin to form internationally, the relationship between Zwingli and Anna is put to a hard test.",

Their objective: to establish a Caliphate and impose sharia - Islamic law - in the heart of Africa. In an attempt to understand who these terrorists are, how they operate, and what kind of a threat they represent to Africa and the rest of the world, we have investigated in Nigeria, Cameroon and on the border of Niger and Nigeria, meeting former prisoners, repented jihadists and troops on the frontline.",

Five days later they lay wounded in the desert sand, shot and captured by the Ethiopian army. But when their initial reportage died, another story began. A story about lawlessness, propaganda and global politics. After a Kafkaesque trial they were sentenced to eleven years in prison for terrorism. And they were far from alone. Their cellmates were journalists, writers and politicians persecuted for not bowing down to dictatorship. Their reportage about oil was transformed into a story about ink, and their daily lives turned into a fight for survival inside the notorious Kality prison in Addis Ababa.",

Pratt, who largely financed the film, made it possible for Leo to use his vision as an artist and filmmaker while the blacklist still over-shadowed his life and ability to work in other areas. Here At The Water’s Edge, a film without narration, draws our attention to the often-neglected life in, on and around water – as well as bringing into view what workers on the water give us. Leo, in his own work, was always concerned with seeing what is happening in spaces in the world where others fail to look.",

But Dom secretly harbours a desire to wear the yellow jersey - just once before his career is over. At the start of what will likely be his last Tour, Dom is unceremoniously dropped from the Team he has dedicated his life to. His best mate Sonny, the team masseur, fails to reassure him about his future. But a chance liaison with Lynn, a young Irish doctor, softens the blow, and Dom starts to accept - and even enjoy - the idea of civilian life. But as he gears up to go home and to face his estranged sister, a massive doping error knocks another teammate off the Tour and Dom is thrown back in the saddle…",

'No Kings' has been made in the same free spirit that defines the lives of the inhabitants of the small community between the sea and the rain forest. Out here, nature itself is the supreme authority. The rest of society with its gods and kings is a distant echo. The vital, saturated universe enshrouds us as we are out catching crabs with the children or hear the rain patter on the roof in the middle of the night. The Caiçara people maintain and cultivate the last remnants of the Atlantic rain forest, and their traditions are based on sustainable values from Brazil, Japan, Africa and Europe. But Brazil's new government has other plans for the rain forest and for the country's many minorities.",
