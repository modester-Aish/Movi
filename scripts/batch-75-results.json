Told first-hand via freewheeling monologues, Portrait of Kaye is a bittersweet portrait of a woman forming her own unique identity while navigating the conflicting influences of her mother’s bawdy humour and her father’s anxieties. Now 74 and recently widowed, her infatuation with a younger neighbour gives her an opportunity to explore personal and sexual freedoms that have always been hidden away. Shot over two years, former next-door neighbour and music video director Ben Reed has assembled a unique and touching meditation on family, film and the meaning of freedom.",

This 'mini' Olympics of Christmas is a multi-ethnic story of unity in diversity. It celebrates how we are all different, but the same, or how we are all 'same difference'. It reminds that Christmas transcends skin colour and racial barriers. It's a rib-tickling comedy that aims to unite borders by helping each of the nations represented to also debunk long-held negative stereotypes and perceptions that the general public always had about them. And of course, somewhere in between all of these, we are treated to endless servings of Akpos' mis-adventures.",
