COUM lived on the edges of society, surviving on meager resources, finding fellowship with others marginalized by the mainstream. At the core of the group were two artists, Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti. As their work evolved, Cosey embarked on a career modeling for pornographic magazines, which she claimed for herself as a conceptual artwork, using it to forge a specific position in relationship to 1970s feminism. In performances, Genesis pushed himself to extremes, testing the limits of the human body.",

Led by a crack Australian team, the best forensic specialists from around the world were in a race against time to give back every victim their identity. Creating forensic history, the international team’s mantra from the outset was ‘we will take them home’, a seemingly impossible ambition but one that almost succeeded. In this film forensic science intersects with powerful stories of survival and loss, attempting to make some sense out of a tragedy so bewilderingly complete that nearly a decade out it still seems far-fetched to most of us.",

What emerges is a deeply human trip to the foundations of discovery and a powerful reminder that the unanswered questions are the most crucial ones to pose.  Directed by Emmy-nominated and Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Ian Cheney and advised by world-renowned filmmaker Werner Herzog, The Most Unknown is an ambitious look at a side of science never before shown on screen.",

    "overview": "What happens to us when we die? It's a question man has asked since the beginning of time. Do we live briefly as physical beings then simply vanish into oblivion, or do we live on in spirit form? Why are we here, and how did we come to be here? Scientists may be closer to answering these and other questions than ever before with the largest study ever done on near-death and out-of-body experiences - the results of which have huge implications on how we view death. The results suggest that our consciousness does not get annihilated when we die. More than 8 million Americans have reported Near Death Experiences that include floating outside of their bodies, moving rapidly through a tunnel toward a light or seeing deceased loved ones. Perhaps death is not an end, but a beginning as we enter new worlds of existence we can only imagine.",
