And although the crux of this story takes place several years ago, the new swarm of antisemitism currently crossing our country makes this story feel extremely relevant. Gersh uses interviews with a holocaust survivor as a brutal reminder of where we could end up again if this culture of hate is not faced by our country. In Accept the Call (WFF 2019) director Eunice Lau’s latest film, the parallel between Europe before the rise of the Nazi party and what happened to Gersh is frightening. – Sabina Barach",

The only way to stop this savage new Ripper is for an even more vicious killer to enter the artificial Qudrant-verse and bring her down. What ensues is a brutal, bloody battle, murderer against murderer, both in this world and the surreal, dangerous, synthetic world of Quadrant!",

As the bodies pile up and reality begins to fray, he's forced to confront the fragmented parts of himself—gender, guilt, memory, and purpose—all while dodging corrupt cops, philosophical assassins, and a cult that worships breakfast fruit. 7 Kills, 3 Songs & a Banana blends gritty crime with absurdist comedy and raw LGBT+ themes, delivering a wild ride that’s equal parts Tarantino, Lynch, and queer theatre. With every song and kill, the line between performance and truth blurs. Is this redemption, revenge, or just another bloody joke? One thing’s certain: you’ve never seen a banana used like this before.",
