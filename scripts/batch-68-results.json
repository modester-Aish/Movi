    "overview": "For centuries, humans have sought to express beauty in architecture and art, but it is only recently that neuroscience is helping to determine how and why beauty plays an important role in our wellbeing. Architects and neuroscientists are embarking on a new field of study in which subliminal responses to one’s built environment may influence the future of design. Experts argue that positive subliminal reactions lead to a pleasurable experience, one reminiscent of a powerful meditation session. The question remains: what makes a building beautiful - or more specifically, which elements of the built environment does the brain recognize as beautiful? Narrated by Martha Stewart.",

To musicians, the bow is as essential to expressing the soul of the music as the violin or cello.  The film follows the journey of the “silent servant” of the music world—from the workshops of the virtuosos of the trade, to the birthplace of the bow in France, and to Brazil, home to the imperiled tree from which the world’s finest bows are made.",

Yet, mysteriously, Rugoff has become a virtually forgotten figure.

    "overview": "The film is a comedy drama about a young woman, Laura, who has distanced herself from her family in the country to settle in Copenhagen as an author and live the artistic bohemian life she has always dreamed of. When she, with much reluctance, goes back home for her brother’s wedding, she realises that he is about to marry her childhood enemy, Catrine. At the same time, Laura finds out that Catrine has in fact taken over her place in the family – and what if Laura wants it back … A film about how we, no matter how hard we try, cannot escape from our past, nor from our roots.",
