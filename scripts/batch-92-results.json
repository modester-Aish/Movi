The ghost terrorizes the sailors, who can’t escape anywhere except into the water that surrounds them. Things get worse when a storm hits. The only way to save the boat and everyone on it is to locate Mia’s body. But there’s more serious question that no one remembers to ask: Who murdered Mia?",

He takes advantage of a visit to his sick mother to look for Sue, but she refuses him. The persuasive rector reverses Soo-hyeon’s decision to leave the seminary with a proposal that he undergo a catharsis in the monastery. The doubting youngster’s new-found peace is lost however when he sees novice Helena, whose similarity to Sue awakens his defused emotions. The cool tonality of the shots of the Korean countryside and the monastery interiors harmonises perfectly with the aesthetically austere, nonetheless suggestive direction, which mediates the young man’s internal conflict and his fear of making the most important decision of his life. The lead role is played by rising star of Korean film Seo Jang-won, whose acting debut in the film The Unforgiven was shown at last",

With rumors of rich girls being kidnapped in the region, and even more so, their legal guardians, including the school's enigmatic headmaster, Mr. Lawrence, and Fumio's brother are suspicious and on alert. Then an accidental and inexplicable unleashing of magic power infuses the girls with spectacular abilities. When the truth about the kidnappings is revealed, they're going to need them.",

As a piece of compelling biography, Manet's is the unlikely tale of the stubborn son of the most highly placed judge in France who decides to become an artist and embarrass his father. The resulting family tensions are the stuff of legend.  Then there was Manet's dramatic private life, including exotic romantic affairs and a particularly horrible death.  Always cited as the father of the Impressionists, Manet stubbornly refused to show with them, and was careful to maintain an aesthetic distance from Monet, Renoir and the others.

Even today, all sorts of people are keeping his instant dream alive. Former Polaroid employee Stephen Herchen moved from the United States to Europe to work in a laboratory developing the 2.0 version of Polaroid. Christopher Bonanos, the author of Instant: The Story of Polaroid, tells us, \"When I heard Polaroid would stop making film, it felt like a close friend had died.\" Artist Stefanie Schneider, who is working with the last of her stock of Polaroid film, is using the blurring that occurs with expired film as an additional aesthetic layer in her photographic work.",

However, one of the last certainties in her life collapses unexpectedly quickly—Father Jan is transferred somewhere to Hradec Králové and is replaced by a young priest who is used to doing everything himself. At that moment, a smiling young man with dark glasses and a flower in his hand enters Květa Galová's life.",
