# ✅ Season/Series Setup Complete (Without MongoDB)

## What Has Been Done:

### 1. **Removed MongoDB Dependencies** ✅
- All series pages now work **without MongoDB**
- Using TMDB API directly for series information
- Using static data file for episodes/seasons mapping

### 2. **Created Static Data Structure** ✅
- File: `app/data/tvSeriesStatic.ts`
- Format: Maps series IMDB ID to seasons and episodes
- Ready for episode data to be added

### 3. **Updated All Pages** ✅

#### Series List (`/series`):
- Shows all TV series posters
- Fetches data from TMDB API
- No MongoDB needed

#### Series Detail (`/series/[slug]`):
- Shows series info + seasons list
- Fetches from TMDB API
- Gets episodes from static data
- Slug format: `series-name-{tmdb_id}`

#### Season Detail (`/series/[slug]/season-X`):
- Shows all episodes in a season
- Uses static data for episodes
- Slug format: `series-name-{tmdb_id}/season-{number}`

#### Episode Player (`/episode/[slug]`):
- Plays episode with VidSrc
- Uses static data for episode info
- Slug format: `episode-name-s01e01-{episode_imdb_id}`

## 📝 How to Add Episode Data:

### Option 1: Manual Entry
Open `app/data/tvSeriesStatic.ts` and add:

```typescript
export const TV_SERIES_STATIC: TVSeriesStatic = {
  "tt0903747": {  // Series IMDB ID
    tmdb_id: 1396,
    name: "Breaking Bad",
    seasons: [
      {
        season_number: 1,
        episodes: [
          { 
            episode_number: 1, 
            episode_imdb_id: "tt0959621", 
            episode_name: "Pilot" 
          },
          // ... more episodes
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Option 2: From Google Sheet (Next Step)
When you provide episode IDs from Google Sheet:
1. I'll fetch the data
2. Generate the static data automatically
3. Add to `tvSeriesStatic.ts`

---

## 🔗 VidSrc Player Format:

Episodes play using:
```
https://vidsrc.xyz/embed/tv/{series_imdb_id}/{season}-{episode}
```

Example:
```
https://vidsrc.xyz/embed/tv/tt0903747/1-1
(Breaking Bad, Season 1, Episode 1)
```

---

## 📊 Data Sources:

1. **Series IDs**: `app/data/tvSeriesIds.ts` (17,926 series from VidSrc)
2. **Series Info**: TMDB API (posters, names, overview, etc.)
3. **Episodes**: `app/data/tvSeriesStatic.ts` (you will add)

---

## ✅ What's Working Now:

- ✅ Series list shows (without MongoDB)
- ✅ Series detail page works (TMDB API)
- ✅ Season pages ready (waiting for episode data)
- ✅ Episode player ready (waiting for episode data)
- ✅ No MongoDB errors
- ✅ All pages use static data

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **You provide episode IDs** (from Google Sheet or any source)
2. I'll add them to `tvSeriesStatic.ts`
3. Seasons and episodes will show automatically
4. Everything will work end-to-end
